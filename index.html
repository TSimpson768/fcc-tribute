    <h3>Einstein's life</h3>
    <div id="tribute-info">
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1879</strong> - Born in the city of Ulm, in what is Germany today.</li><br>

        <li><strong>1896</strong> - Contary to a well known myth, Einstein passes his high school exams and attends 
        the Federal Polytechnic School, Zurich. He had previously failed the portion of his enterance exams on botany, zoology and languages.</li><br>
        <li><strong>1901</strong> - Begins work in a patent office in Bern.</li><br>        
        <li><strong>1905</strong> - Einstein's <i>Annus mirabilis</i>. Four papers on the Photoelectric effect, Brownian Motion,
             special relativity, and most famously the equivalence of mass and energy, where the formula E=mc<sup>2</sup> originates, are published.
            Einstein also gained his PhD from the University of Zurich.</li><br>
            <li><strong>1908</strong> - Becomes a lecturer at the Univeristy of Bern. Rises to position of associate profesor in a year.</li><br>  
            <li><strong>1911</strong> - Becomes a full profesor at Charles-Ferdinand University, Prague. </li><br> 
            <li><strong>1912</strong> - Returns to the Federal Polytechnic School, Zurich as a Professor.</li><br>
            <li><strong>1914</strong> - Becomes a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences and moves to Berlin.</li><br>
            <li><strong>1917</strong> - Predicts the process of Stimulated Emission, used to develop lasers.</li><br>
            <li><strong>1919</strong> - Predictions from General Relativity that light should be bent by gravity are experimentally verified.</li><br> 
            <li><strong>1921</strong> - Awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, for his work on the Photoelectric effect.</li><br>
            <li><strong>1924</strong> - Working with Satyendra Nath Bose, he predicts the formation of a state of matter known as a Bose-Einstein condensate. This was verified experimentally in 1995.</li><br>
            <li><strong>1933</strong> - Emmigrates to America, to escape the rise of the Nazi party. He becomes a scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton.</li><br>
            <li><strong>1935</strong> - Challenges quantum mechanics via the EPR paradox, which suggests faster than light transfer of information, or
            "Spooky action at a distance".</li><br>
            <li><strong>1939</strong> - Before the outbreak of World War 2, signs a letter encoraging the USA's development of nuclear weapons. He considered This
            the greatest mistace in his life. </li><br>

    </ul>
